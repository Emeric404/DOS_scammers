# DOS_scammers
Use this simple python tool to bombard a scammer web site (denial-of-service) so that nobody gets scammed form that site. Just provide a link and number of threads on the url.json file and run the DOS.py file, that's it. It is recommended to run the script on a cloud server.

You can also add proxies with a little change on the script.


instructions:
1. Add the web site link on the url.json file.
2. provide number of threads you wanna run ( defult is 100) and store url.json on the same directory as DOS.py
3. Run the DOS.py file and done!
