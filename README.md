# DOS Scammers

DOS Scammers is a Python-based tool designed for performing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on a website. This tool is intended to target scam websites with the goal of preventing fraudulent activities. 

**Warning:** Using this tool to attack websites without permission is illegal and unethical. This tool should only be used for educational purposes or on websites where you have explicit authorization.

## Features

- **Multi-Threaded Requests:** The tool can send multiple requests concurrently by using multiple threads.
- **Configurable:** Easily adjust the number of threads and target URL via a configuration file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (No additional packages required)

## Configuration

1. **Create `url.json`:**
   - This JSON file should be placed in the same directory as `DOS.py`.
   - The file should include the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "url": "http://example.com",
     "number of threads": 100
   }
   ```

   - `"url"`: The URL of the target website.
   - `"number of threads"`: The number of threads to use (default is 100).

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the `DOS.py` script with Python:

   ```bash
   python DOS.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setup `url.json`:**
   - Edit the file to include the target URL and the desired number of threads.
   - Save the file in the same directory as `DOS.py`.

2. **Execute the Script:**
   - Run the Python script to initiate the attack.

3. **Monitor Progress:**
   - The script will display the number of requests sent and any errors encountered.

## Example

For a `url.json` file configured as follows:

```json
{
  "url": "http://example-scam-website.com",
  "number of threads": 50
}
```

Running `DOS.py` will start a DoS attack using 50 threads against `http://example-scam-website.com`.
