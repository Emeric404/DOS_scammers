# DOS_scammers
Use this simple python tool to bombard a scammer web site (denial-of-service) so that nobody gets scammed form that site. Just provide a link and number of threads on the url.json file and run the DOS.py file, that's it. It is recommended to run the script on a cloud server.

You can also add proxies with a little change on the script.


instructions:
Since I have only used the byilt it modules, you don't have to install anything!

1. Add the web site link on the url.json file.
2. provide number of threads you wanna run ( defult is 100) and store url.json on the same directory as DOS.py
3. Run the DOS.py file and done!



But always remember, ddos-ing is illeagal and you should not use this tool against any legit sites and even if you do so, I'll not be the one to blame.
